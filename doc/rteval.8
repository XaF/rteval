.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS

[\-X " host " ]"

.\" .SH DESCRIPTION
.\" This manual page documents briefly the
.\" .B rteval command.
.\" .PP
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, respectively.
.\" \fBcyclictest\fP is a program that...

The rteval program is used to evaluate the realtime performance of a
realtime Linux kernel on a particular hardware system. There is
nothing that actually requires a realtime Linux kernel, but the
latency measurements will usually be pretty bad on a stock Linux
kernel. 


.SH OPTIONS
These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes ('\-\-').
.br
A summary of options is included below.
.\" For a complete description, see the Info files.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print a help message with a complete list of commands. In this man page,
we only present the native commands provided by rteval. The modules
provided commands will only be readable in the help message.
.TP
.B -d, \-\-duration=DURATION
Specify the length of the measurement run. DURATION is an integer with
an optional suffix indicating the units:

.br
   s - seconds
.br
   m - minutes
.br
   h - hours
.br
   d - days
.br
for example to execute a ten minute run of rteval:
.br
     $ rteval \-\-duration=10m
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Increase the verbosity of output during the test run
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
Turn of the quiet mode which will disable error and warning messages
.TP
.B \-w, \-\-workdir=WORKDIR
Tell rteval to change directory to WORKDIR before creating any
subdirectories for report files. The default WORKDIR is the directory
in which rteval was started. 
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-loaddir=LOADDIR
Tell rteval where to find the source for the loads
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-installdir=INSTALLDIR
Tell rteval to locate installed templates in INSTALLDIR instead of
the default install directory.
.TP
.B \-P, \-\-xmlrpc\-no\-abort
Do not abort if XML-RPC server do not respond to ping request
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-sysreport
Have rteval run the sysreport utility after a run to gather
information on the running system.
.TP
.B \-D, \-\-debug
Turn on debugging prints during run
.TP
.B \-X, \-\-xmprpc-submit=HOST
Have rteval send report data to HOST following the run, using XML-RPC
.TP
.B \-Z, \-\-summarize
Have rteval summarize an existing report. This will not cause loads or
measurement utilities to be run.
.B \-H, \-\-raw-histogram
Generate raw histogram data for an already existing XML report
.TP
.B \-f FILE, \-\-inifile=FILE
Sets FILE as the initialization file for configuring loads and behavior
.TP
.B \-a STRING, \-\-annotate=STRING
Add a little annotation which is stored in the report
.TP
.B \-L, \-\-logging
Sets a flag to log the output of the loads in the report directory
.TP
.B \-O, \-\-onlyload
Sets a flag to only run the loads (don't run measurement threads)

.SH FILES
.BR rteval-YYYYMMDD-S
This is a directory created by rteval to hold the summary.xml file as
well as other files collected on the system. It is the current Year,
Month, and Day, followed by a sequence number for multiple runs on the
same day. 

.BR summary.xml
This is an XML file that contains information about a test run and the
host system upon which rteval was run.
.BR dmesg
This is the output of the dmesg(1) program immediately following
system boot. It is copied from /var/log/dmesg.
